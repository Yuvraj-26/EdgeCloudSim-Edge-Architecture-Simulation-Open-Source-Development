# Edge / Cloud Architecture Simulation 
Created by Yuvraj M

## Project Summary

IoT devices use **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning** to provide intelligence and autonomy to systems. The unprecedented scale and complexity of data generated by IoT devices uncover the limitations of cloud computing. As a result, **Edge Computing**, a distributed computing paradigm that brings data storage and computation resources to the network edge, is proposed to fulfil IoT requirements such as latency, location awareness, and mobility support. 

Edge computing involves more complex architecture design; hence both computational and networking resources are analysed. In this investigation, EdgeCloudSim is utilised to investigate the effect of scalability parameters in an edge environment. A technical evaluation for each significant parameter identifies if the architecture remains
effective after increasing the number of users (load condition) and resources. This project investigates the **scalability** of three edge architectures: **single-tier**, **two-tier**, and **two-tier with Edge Orchestrator (EO)** for a face recognition / augmented reality application that demands low latency and percentage of failed tasks.

# EdgeCloudSim

# Experiment Design

The following stages outline the experiment design:

1. **Initial experiment**: This is designed as an experiment base to identify parameters that require investigation across three edge architectures.

2. **Effect of edge servers**: This is designed to investigate the availability of edge servers
by evaluating an increase in edge servers on the percentage of failed tasks.

3. **Effect of WLAN bandwidth**: This is designed to investigate the effect of increasing
WLAN bandwidth on the network delay.

4. **Effect of VM processing speed**: This is designed to investigate increasing VM
processing speed on the percentage of failed tasks.

5. **Effect of WLAN bandwidth and VM processing speed**: This is designed to investigate the effect of increasing both WLAN bandwidth and VM processing speed on
performance in terms of scalability.  

# Hypthesis Confirmation

The devised hypotheses for this empirical investigation are validated with the findings of the
experiment.


✅ **Hypothesis 1** – An increase in the number of edge servers reduces the percentage of
failed tasks, service time, and VM utilisation.

✅ **Hypothesis 2** – An increase in WLAN bandwidth reduces the network delay

✅ **Hypothesis 3** – An Increase in VM processing speed reduces the percentage of failed
tasks

✅ **Hypothesis 4**– An increase in VM processing speed and WLAN bandwidth reduces the
percentage of failed tasks, service time, and VM utilisation


# Recommendations for Future Edge Architecture Design and implementation

1. **Edge Architecture scalability**  – The recommended edge architecture for a face recognition application in augmented reality is a two-tier architecture with EO. This architecture offers superior performance and scalability compared to other options. Under increased load conditions, the two-tier with EO consistently outperforms other architectures in terms of failed tasks and service time. While VM utilization is high due to other edge servers, it can be significantly reduced by adjusting scalability parameters.

2. **The link between VM processing Speed and WLAN bandwidth** – The link between VM processing speed and WLAN bandwidth was investigated in relation to edge servers. Experiments revealed that increasing WLAN bandwidth improves WLAN delay but does not significantly reduce failed tasks, especially under high load conditions. On the other hand, increasing VM processing speed leads to a notable decrease in failed tasks but does not improve network delay. Consequently, increasing both parameters results in increased WLAN bandwidth facilitating faster task request arrival, while enhanced VM processing speed ensures effective handling of all requests. The combination of these key parameters further improves scalability and overall performance.

3. **The trade-off between performance and computational resources** – Optimal edge computing configurations vary based on application demands. For latency-sensitive and real-time applications, a setup with 900 Mbps WLAN bandwidth and 4000 MIPS processing speed achieves near-zero failed tasks. A slightly lower performance, with 700 Mbps WLAN bandwidth and 3000 MIPS, suffices for certain applications. Strategic simulation-based deployment of edge resources, considering requirements and cost/energy factors, is recommended.


4. **Handling the mobility of IoT devices** – To support mobility in wireless networks, low-latency task processing is vital. Task failure due to mobility serves as a key metric, requiring dynamic resource migration across edge nodes. For IoT devices, allocating sufficient computational resources ensures timely task completion before leaving the WLAN area. Efficient handoff of processing requests is recommended for highly mobile devices like driverless vehicles.

## Ease of Use
EdgeCloudSim reads parameters dynamically from the following files:
- **config.properties:** Simulation settings are managed in configuration file
- **applications.xml:** Application properties are stored in xml file
- **edge_devices.xml:** Edge devices (datacenters, hosts, VMs etc.) are defined in xml file

## Analyzing the Results
At the end of each iteration, simulation results will be compressed in the *output/date/ite_n.tgz* files. When you extract these tgz files, you will see lots of log file in csv format. You can find matlab files which can plot graphics by using these files under *scripts/sample_application/matlab* folder. You can also write other scripts (e.g. python scripts) with the same manner of matlab plotter files.

# EdgeCloudSim: An Environment for Performance Evaluation of Edge Computing Systems

EdgeCloudSim provides a modular architecture to provide support for a variety of crucial functionalities such as network modeling specific to WLAN and WAN, device mobility model, realistic and tunable load generator. As depicted in Figure 2, the current EdgeCloudSim version has five main modules available: Core Simulation, Networking, Load Generator, Mobility and Edge Orchestrator. To ease fast prototyping efforts, each module contains a default implementation that can be easily extended.

## Mobility Module
The mobility module manages the location of edge devices and clients. Since CloudSim focuses on the conventional cloud computing principles, the mobility is not considered in the framework. In our design, each mobile device has x and y coordinates which are updated according to the dynamically managed hash table. By default, we provide a nomadic mobility model, but different mobility models can be implemented by extending abstract MobilityModel class.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/doc/images/mobility_module.png" width="55%">
</p>

## Load Generator Module
The load generator module is responsible for generating tasks for the given configuration. By default, the tasks are generated according to a Poisson distribution via active/idle task generation pattern. If other task generation patterns are required, abstract LoadGeneratorModel class should be extended.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/doc/images/task_generator_module.png" width="50%">
</p>

## Networking Module
The networking module particularly handles the transmission delay in the WLAN and WAN by considering both upload and download data. The default implementation of the networking module is based on a single server queue model. Users of EdgeCloudSim can incorporate their own network behavior models by extending abstract NetworkModel class.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/doc/images/network_module.png" width="55%">
</p>

## Edge Orchestrator Module
The edge orchestrator module is the decision maker of the system. It uses the information collected from the other modules to decide how and where to handle incoming client requests. In the first version, we simply use a probabilistic approach to decide where to handle incoming tasks, but more realistic edge orchestrator can be added by extending abstract EdgeOrchestrator class.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/doc/images/edge_orchestrator_module.png" width="65%">
</p>

## Core Simulation Module
The core simulation module is responsible for loading and running the Edge Computing scenarios from the configuration files. In addition, it offers a logging mechanism to save the simulation results into the files. The results are saved in comma-separated value (CSV) data format by default, but it can be changed to any format.

## Extensibility
EdgeCloudSim uses a factory pattern making easier to integrate new models mentioned above. As shown in Figure 2, EdgeCloudsim requires a scenario factory class which knows the creation logic of the abstract modules. If you want to use different mobility, load generator, networking and edge orchestrator module, you can use your own scenario factory which provides the concrete implementation of your custom modules.
